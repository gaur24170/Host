Bluehost is a well-known and widely used hosting provider, particularly popular for WordPress integration. While not specifically tailored for video streaming, their robust infrastructure and affordable plans make them a viable option for smaller VOD platforms.

### Performance and Reliability:
Bluehost boasts a generally reliable network with good uptime. They utilize SSD storage, which provides faster data access compared to traditional HDDs, leading to quicker loading times for your video content. However, they don't offer specific CDN integrations in their base plans, which might impact video delivery to a global audience.

### Storage and Bandwidth:
Bluehost's shared hosting plans come with varying storage limits, from 10 GB on the Basic plan to unmetered storage on the Choice Plus and Pro plans.  Bandwidth is also unmetered on most plans, but it's important to note their acceptable use policy might restrict excessive bandwidth consumption that could negatively affect other users on the shared server. This could be a concern for high-traffic VOD sites.

### Security Features:
Bluehost provides a free SSL certificate, which is essential for encrypting data transmitted between your website and viewers. They also offer features like automated backups and spam protection. More advanced security options, such as malware scanning and intrusion detection, may require additional costs.

### Customer Support:

### Pricing:
