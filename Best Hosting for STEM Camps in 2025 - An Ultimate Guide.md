The interface is intuitive and user-friendly, making it easy for even beginners to manage their hosting environment.

### High Performance and Scalability:

This is crucial for STEM camp websites with a lot of images, videos, or interactive elements. As your camp grows, you can easily scale your resources (CPU, RAM, storage) to accommodate increasing traffic and data.
